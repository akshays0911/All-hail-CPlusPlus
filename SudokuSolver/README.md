Sudoku (数独 sūdoku, digit-single) (/suːˈdoʊkuː/, /-ˈdɒk-/, /sə-/, originally called Number Place)[1] is a logic-based,[2][3] combinatorial[4] number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

Programming is fun. Programming to solve a complex puzzle is even more fun. Here the SudokuSolver is going to solve simple to complex sudoku puzzles. My aim here is to build an app to solve this puzzle also integrating some Computer Vision techniques into it.
